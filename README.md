This Plugin adds a new Command to go to a specific Line and Character in Obsidian.
You can find the Command using the Command Palette or set a Hotkey for it.
When using it a Textfield will appear,
you can type in just the Line Number or do `line:column`, for example `15:27` for Line 15 and Character 27.

2. Click on **Browse** and search for „Go to Line“
3. Click install
